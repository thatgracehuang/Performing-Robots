Originally made by Bruce Lacey as a piss-take for a poetry convention he was invited to as his original idea of smashing a statue was denied. The robot was originally named John Silent and made only fart noises. THe attendees at the convention regarded it highly as avant garde and a new form of noise poetry. John Silent then had a sex change to Rosa Bosom and went on to play on the ROyal Court Theater and in various productions and TV appearances. Rosa is made from a number of salvaged parts, with limbs made from prosthetic arms and legs and a mouth from a dentists tooth selection chart.
