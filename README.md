A robot who fails repeatedly to pass butter and is dismayed by this. Part of a genre(?) of "Shitty Robots" who fail at the job they appear designed for. Their being designed and programmed to fail for comedic effect is what makes these robots performative.

Group Project 
My partner Isabella and I are interested thematically in the idea of love and especially romantic love. We came up with a number of ways we could explore this and haven't decided on a final form of the project. We are also very interested in having a dancer interacting with the technological elements. One thing we are also particularly interested in incorporating are cassette players in the IM Lab, which would involve buying a tape deck and cassettes. 
Another possibility we were thinking about was a moving, glowing garden make of animatronics, both foam and acrylic, where touching them makes them move away or trigger responses in the software art/text.
We also thought about some kind of fortune-telling robot, like ones found on Coney Island: https://www.google.com/search?q=fortunetelling+machine&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEpJ3TkZrXAhUkIcAKHccEDLkQ_AUICygC&biw=1440&bih=826#imgrc=E90WXQHQaoFv0M: that can generate fortunes.
In terms of text, we were also very interested in the idea of branching storylines, though we in general are trying to decide whether the generative-ness/autonomy of the devices could be apparent and how that could be shown to the audience.

14th Nov 2017  - Updates about final robot design
The design I am thinking of for my robot will involve a tape recorder mounted vertically on the back of a standard 4 leg chair. I plan to have a person sitting on the chair also, with their back to the audience for the entire performance. I imagine the chair and recorder to be the body of the robot, and it is in the role of a story-teller who then tells stories of its many loves, through a website that each person listens to on their headphones, so that each person hears a different individual branch of the story. Throughout this, the tape recorder is rolling, transcribing all of the stories at once into the cassette, to be played at the end as a kind of "master" story with all the branches. The robot will also physically embody these stories on stage somehow with moving parts attached to the chair. The person on the chair acts as a kind of magicians assistant, helping the robot to do this, this person can also act as the second person in the love stories the robot tells. Because of the branching storylines, I think it will be important to establish the robot both as the actor/storyteller fabricating the tales, and as the character that experiences them in the stories.
Here is an image of an possible aesthetic I would like to draw from.

I would also like to draw from the idea of fortunetelling machines and the tacky fake-mysticism of their style.


  UPDATE: after meeting with Isabella, we have decided on a story, context and structure. At the beginning we, or the human "assistant" will guide the audience to a website where they can each play an audio file. This will be randomly generated for each audience member. If they do not have headphones they can hold their phone to their ear like a phonecall. The performance will be a robot who was someone's office printer/microwave/coffee maker/office computer/phone/cassette recorder (as it will be a branched story, surreal story). The robot will look as if it was made up of a collage of appliances that have been slowly added to its body. When audiences hear of the start of the story, I want them to perhaps want to identify the robot's "original" or first body. The robot will describe a series of events during its relationship, which inevitably ends in their partner leaving them. 
  The robot will come across as a time-wearied storyteller, with the human assistant acting as both helper, nurse and prop for the story. Actions made by both actors help to underscore the story being told, as though it is different for each person, it has common structures. The robot's text will also appear to ask questions or give orders to the human assistant, who will respond. This will be choreographed.
  Once the robot finishes, its story a tape being played which has compiled a soundscape of all the individual stories, showing moments of convergence and divergence, but all ending the same way. The robot will then tell the audience how it always wanted to experience what-if it had made a particular choice it its relationship, and thanks the audience for letting it travel down one of the what-ifs? It will say that somewhere in there, was the true story, but it will leave it to the audience to decide which that was.

16th Nov 2017 - What to accomplish by 16th Nov and 21st Nov

16th - I plan to find out how feasible making a website for the audience to log into will be. I also want to find materials for my robot, come up with 4 actions it can perform (2 alone and two with the human assistant's aid) and then how to enable that with the materials in the IM lab. 
21st - I want to finalise a design for the robot and begin building it. I also want to start finalising the script with Isabella.
