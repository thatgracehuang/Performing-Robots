# Performing-Robots

A robot who fails repeatedly to pass butter and is dismayed by this. Part of a genre(?) of "Shitty Robots" who fail at the job they appear designed for. Their being designed and programmed to fail for comedic effect is what makes these robots performative.

Group Project 
My partner Isabella and I are interested thematically in the idea of love and especially romantic love. We came up with a number of ways we could explore this and haven't decided on a final form of the project. We are also very interested in having a dancer interacting with the technological elements. One thing we are also particularly interested in incorporating are cassette players in the IM Lab, which would involve buying a tape deck and cassettes. 
Another possibility we were thinking about was a moving, glowing garden make of animatronics, both foam and acrylic, where touching them makes them move away or trigger responses in the software art/text.
We also thought about some kind of fortune-telling robot, like ones found on Coney Island: https://www.google.com/search?q=fortunetelling+machine&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEpJ3TkZrXAhUkIcAKHccEDLkQ_AUICygC&biw=1440&bih=826#imgrc=E90WXQHQaoFv0M: that can generate fortunes.
In terms of text, we were also very interested in the idea of branching storylines, though we in general are trying to decide whether the generative-ness/autonomy of the devices could be apparent and how that could be shown to the audience.

Updates about robot design 14th Nov 2017
The design I am thinking of for my robot will involve a tape recorder mounted vertically on the back of a standard 4 leg chair. I plan to have a person sitting on the chair also, with their back to the audience for the entire performance. I imagine the chair and recorder to be the body of the robot, and it is in the role of a story-teller who then tells stories of its many loves, through a website that each person listens to on their headphones, so that each person hears a different individual branch of the story. Throughout this, the tape recorder is rolling, transcribing all of the stories at once into the cassette, to be played at the end as a kind of "master" story with all the branches. The robot will also physically embody these stories on stage somehow with moving parts attached to the chair. The person on the chair acts as a kind of magicians assistant, helping the robot to do this, this person can also act as the second person in the love stories the robot tells. Because of the branching storylines, I think it will be important to establish the robot both as the actor/storyteller fabricating the tales, and as the character that experiences them in the stories.

Here is an image of an possible aesthetic I would like to draw from.

I would also like to draw from the idea of fortunetelling machines and the tacky fake-mysticism of their style.
