A robot who fails repeatedly to pass butter and is dismayed by this. Part of a genre(?) of "Shitty Robots" who fail at the job they appear designed for. Their being designed and programmed to fail for comedic effect is what makes these robots performative.

Group Project 
My partner Isabella and I are interested thematically in the idea of love and especially romantic love. We came up with a number of ways we could explore this and haven't decided on a final form of the project. We are also very interested in having a dancer interacting with the technological elements. One thing we are also particularly interested in incorporating are cassette players in the IM Lab, which would involve buying a tape deck and cassettes. 
Another possibility we were thinking about was a moving, glowing garden make of animatronics, both foam and acrylic, where touching them makes them move away or trigger responses in the software art/text.
We also thought about some kind of fortune-telling robot, like ones found on Coney Island: https://www.google.com/search?q=fortunetelling+machine&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=0ahUKEwiEpJ3TkZrXAhUkIcAKHccEDLkQ_AUICygC&biw=1440&bih=826#imgrc=E90WXQHQaoFv0M: that can generate fortunes.
