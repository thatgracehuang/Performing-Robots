Area of greatest risk and an answer to the manual override question - This would be making sure the audio on phones and the actions on stage synced up. It would be good to run all actions and text against the same clock. A phrase could also be generated that apologised before resetting to a particular point in the script. A reset switch could be built into the robots code.

Story thoughts:
The robot was created as a story-telling program
It fell in love with its creator
It’s  creator helped to create and modify its body for telling more stories (such as by recording them with a tape recorder) - which is why it looks like it does now.
Robot continues storytelling in memory of that lover?
Robot is made of junk parts, but tidily arranged.
This robot is not mobile, it tells stories because it cannot move around to see the world
Relationship with assistant is same as magician and magician’s asisstant
